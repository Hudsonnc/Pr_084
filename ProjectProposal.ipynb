    "There is clearly a complicated relationship between the availability of work, transportation infrastructure, and affluence. Cities can be too expensive for many to live in, but they are the centers of much economic activity. Therefore, in counties without strong transportation infrastructure between more affordable areas and city centers, we expect to observe lower economic mobility and lower overall affluence.\n",
    "A 2015 paper by Brian McKenzie of the US Census Bureau, “Transit Access and Population Change: The Demographic Profiles of Rail-Accessible Neighborhoods in the Washington, DC Area“, found that “young adults, recent movers, white workers, highly educated workers, and workers with high earnings all disproportionately live near rail stops” in Washington, DC and the five surrounding counties. This suggests that there is a positive correlation between rail accessibility and affluence. However, it is unclear whether transportation access is causal for affluence or vice versa. \n",
    "We do not intend to focus solely on economic affluence as a measure of ‘livability’, and so we also find relevant a paper by Stephan Goetz, et al., “County-Level Determinants of Mental Health, 2002–2008”. The researchers investigated the contributing factors of happiness and mental health, including educational attainment, employment, ‘social capital’, and environmental/weather factors. The general conclusion of the study ”is that living in a non-metro county and adjacent to a metro core is associated with greater happiness”. We wish to further investigate if and how transportation infrastructure impact this effect. \n",

Then we would have to collect and redistribute data regarding each region - for example, in some datasets La Jolla might be considered a different region (by having a separate row) than San Diego. We need to collect all the La Jolla data and add them to San Diego. Data will be analyzed based on county in order to simplify the manual process. \n",
    "\n",
    "After getting all the data redistributed to the corresponding counties and processed, we will work on the visualization and graphing of the correlations. We need to first draw out the corresponding data points for each transportation category and livability category to see if any significant findings are present for the corresponding sub-category. Then we will calculate the average transportation index and livability index for each region and draw out the data points to see if there is any significant correlations between these two general indexes. At last, we will attempt to visualize the results by drawing out the correlation for each significant finding.\n",

    "*What to report (2-3 sentences)*\n",

    "Potential obstacles in our methodology could arise in response to the feasibility in cleaning and redistributing data sources. As previously mentioned within certain counties there may be outliers that don’t get classified in the grander region in which it resides i.e. La Jolla. In order to address more specific biases that could arise in our data sets we need to thoroughly research our sources and read through the procedure and conditions in which our data were originally gathered. A potential confound that must be addressed within our data sets that may have not been addressed originally that could create biases range from levels of income within certain regions and other uncontrollable forces such as nature and specifically weather patterns within that region that could be linked to overall livability and general happiness for that given individual. \n",

If we choose to wipe/clean some of our data, that original data may hold an answer or another experimental question that could be answered. Even if our hypothesis end up being incorrect we will have the data models and sets necessary to potentially find new sources of significant correlation. \n",
